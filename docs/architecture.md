# Architecture

Moved out of `README.md` so the README can stay an introduction. See
[`PLAN.md`](../PLAN.md) §1.3 for the vertical-slice build order these crates
were built in, and [`docs/capabilities.md`](capabilities.md) for what each
stage can do today.

## Pipeline

```
Source .jr
  → Lexer (hand-written, trivia-preserving)
  → Parser (hand-written, error-recovering, recursive descent)
  → Lossless CST (rowan)          ← jr fmt consumes this directly
  → Typed AST accessors
  → HIR (desugar, module graph, #import resolution, scopes)
  → Sema (lazy on-demand: types, inference, const-eval, polymorphs)
      ↔ InternPool (canonical IDs for every type and comptime value)
      ↔ Bytecode VM (#run / #insert / comptime FFI)
  → MIR (typed SSA, monomorphized)
  → Mid-end (inliner, mem2reg, DCE, const-prop)
  → Cranelift backend  →  object file  →  cc driver + codesign  →  native binary
  → LLVM backend (behind a default-off `llvm` cargo feature)
  → salsa DB  →  LSP server (diagnostics, hover, goto-def)

tree-sitter-jairs  — separate editor grammar, CI-gated against drift
```

The LSP is a **consumer of the same salsa queries** as the batch compiler, not
a second frontend. The VM and Cranelift both consume the same MIR so `#run`
and runtime cannot silently disagree — and the mid-end is required to keep
that literally true, not merely approximately: the inliner refuses to rewrite
any body compile-time evaluation can reach (ADR-0021 §2), so every body both
engines might execute is bit-identical in each.

## Crate layout

| Crate | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `jr-base` | Foundational types: source spans, `FileId`, string interning, arenas, newtype IDs |
| `jr-diag` | Diagnostic model (severity, spans, notes, instantiation backtraces) and rustc-identical renderer |
| `jr-syntax` | Lexer, `SyntaxKind`, error-recovering recursive-descent parser, lossless `rowan` CST, typed AST accessors |
| `jr-fmt` | Canonical formatter — a pure function over the lossless CST |
| `jr-hir` | Desugared high-level IR: module graph, `#import` resolution, scopes, name binding |
| `jr-pool` | `InternPool`: canonical identities for every type and every compile-time value, plus the layout both back ends share (ADR-0018 §2) |
| `jr-sema` | Lazy on-demand semantic analysis: type checking, inference, const-evaluation, polymorph instantiation |
| `jr-mir` | Typed SSA mid-level IR and optimisation passes, including the inliner Cranelift does not provide |
| `jr-vm` | Bytecode compile-time execution engine: lowering from MIR, interpreter, comptime FFI bridge |
| `jr-codegen` | `Backend` trait and lowering helpers shared by every native backend |
| `jr-codegen-clif` | Cranelift backend — all Cranelift API contact is confined here (ADR-0009) |
| `jr-codegen-llvm` | LLVM back end via `inkwell`, behind a default-off `llvm` cargo feature and gate 7 (ADR-0143). The third execution engine the differential harness compares |
| `jr-link` | Object-file emission and system linker driver, including macOS ad-hoc codesigning |
| `jr-db` | salsa query database — single source of truth shared by the batch driver and the LSP; the type pool is an `RwLock` whose read half is `Db::read_pool` (ADR-0149 §1) |
| `jr-driver` | Compilation orchestration: workspaces, compiler message queue, build metaprograms. Still a one-line stub — see `PLAN.md` §1.5 |
| `jr-lsp` | Language server — a consumer of `jr-db` queries, never a second frontend |
| `jr-cli` | The `jr` binary (`jr build`, `jr run`, `jr fmt`, `jr check`) |
